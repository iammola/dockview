# Nested Dockviews

You can safely create multiple dockview instances within one page and nest dockviews within other dockviews.
If you wish to interact with the drop event from one dockview instance in another dockview instance you can implement the `api.onUnhandledDragOverEvent` and `onDidDrop` props on `DockviewReact`.

<CodeRunner id="dockview/nested" />
