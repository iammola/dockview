Dockview components accept a `theme` property which is highly customizable, the theme is largly controlled through CSS however some properties can only be adjusted
by direct editing variables of the `theme` object.

Firstly, you should import `dockview.css`:

<FrameworkSpecific framework='JavaScript'>
```css
@import './node_modules/dockview-core/dist/styles/dockview.css';
```
</FrameworkSpecific>

<FrameworkSpecific framework='React'>
```css
@import './node_modules/dockview-react/dist/styles/dockview.css';
```
</FrameworkSpecific>

<FrameworkSpecific framework='Vue'>
```css
@import './node_modules/dockview-vue/dist/styles/dockview.css';
```
</FrameworkSpecific>


## Provided themes

`dockview` comes with a number of built-in themes. Each theme is represented as an object that can be imported.

For dock components you should pass the theme object to the `theme` property, for other components such as split, pane and grid views you should
use set the themes associated CSS class to the `className` property.

```tsx
import { themeAbyss } from "dockview";

// For dock components
theme={themeAbyss}

// For other components
const {className} = themeAbyss;
```

:::info
The source code for all themes can be found [here](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/blob/master/packages/dockview-core/src/theme.scss) and the associated CSS [here](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/blob/master/packages/dockview-core/src/theme.scss).
:::

## Build your own theme

You can define your own `DockviewTheme` object and pass it to the `theme` property.

<DocRef declaration="DockviewTheme" />


## Customizing Theme

The provided themes are controlled primarily through a long list of CSS variables which can be modified by the user either entirely for a new theme
or partial for a modification to an existing theme.

## Extending Theme

You can extends existing themes or create new themes.

As an example if you wanted to extend the **dockview-theme-abyss** theme to dislay a within the tabs container you
may try:


```css
.dockview-theme-abyss {
  .groupview {
      &.active-group {
          > .tabs-and-actions-container {
              border-bottom: 2px solid var(--dv-activegroup-visiblepanel-tab-background-color);
          }
      }
      &.inactive-group {
          > .tabs-and-actions-container {
              border-bottom: 2px solid var(--dv-inactivegroup-visiblepanel-tab-background-color);
          }
      }
  }
}
```
