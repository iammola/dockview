# Release Notes

Please reference docs @ [dockview.dev](https://dockview.dev).

## ðŸš€ Features
- To control the theme of dockview you should no longer pass a `dv-theme-*` class, instead directly use the `theme` property. See [Themes](https://dockview.dev/demo) for more details. [#850](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/pull/850)
- Introduces a new dnd overlay model with improved animations and customization options allowing themes to take more fine grained control over the dnd overlay styles. [#850](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/pull/850)
- Custom scrollbar on tab headers for better UX [#822](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/pull/822)
- When tabs are hidden within scrollbar hidden tabs can be selected from a dropdown that appears in header [#822](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/pull/822)

## ðŸ›  Miscs

- Bug: Remove elements from DOM after disposable for Splitview and Paneview components [#870](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/pull/870)

## ðŸ”¥ Breaking changes

- `setGap(gap: number | undefined): void` and `gap(): number` have been removed. The gap property is now controlled directly within the chosen Theme. See [Themes](https://dockview.dev)  for more details.
- `DockviewDefaultTab` requires a `tabLocation` field, to mimic existing behaviour use `tabLocation="header"`.
